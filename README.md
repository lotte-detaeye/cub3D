## üìã Project Overview

This project is a simplified recreation of the classic game Wolfenstein 3D, implemented in C. The game uses a raycasting algorithm to render a 3D maze from a 2D map. The player navigates the maze from a first-person perspective, experiencing a retro-style 3D environment. The display is handled using the MiniLibX (MiniLibX Graphics Library).

The focus of this project is to explore foundational game development techniques and computer graphics concepts, such as:

* Raycasting
  
* Grid-based movement
  
* Handling player input
  
* Rendering 2D maps into 3D spaces


## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

**Language**: C

**Graphics Library**: MiniLibX (mlx)

**Platform**: Linux


## üìê How Raycasting Works

Raycasting is a rendering technique that simulates a 3D perspective by casting rays from the player's position into the game world to determine what walls and objects should be displayed on the screen.

Here's a brief breakdown of the process:

* **Raycasting Loop**: The player‚Äôs field of view is divided into vertical strips, and rays are cast to detect walls in the maze.

* **Distance Calculation**: The distance between the player and the walls is calculated to determine how tall the walls should appear.

* **Wall Rendering**: Based on the distance, walls are drawn as vertical strips, creating the illusion of depth.


## üöÄ Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

* Linux

* MiniLibX library (included in the project)

**Building the Project**

Clone the repository and run the make command to compile the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/lotte-detaeye/cub3D.git
make
```

**Running the Game**

After building the project, launch the game with:

```
./cub3d <map_file>
```
Example:

```
./cub3d maps/test1.cub
```


## üéÆ Controls

| Keys | Actions |
| ------------|-------------| 
| **W** | Move forward | 
| **S** | Move backward | 
| **A** | Move left | 
| **D** | Move right | 
| **Left arrow** | Turn left | 
| **Right arrow** | Turn right | 
| **ESC** | Quit the game| 


## üìã Map Files

Map files are simple text files that define the layout of the maze. They use the following format:

| Symbol | Map feature |
| ------------|-------------| 
| **0** | Empty Space| 
| **1** | Wall| 
| **O, N, S or W** | Player starting position and viewing direction | 

Example of a basic map:

```
111111
100001
100W01
100001
111111
```


## üñºÔ∏è MiniLibX Library

The MiniLibX (mlx) is a lightweight graphics library used to handle window creation, drawing, and event handling in the game. It's compatible with linux and is commonly used in game development projects.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Extras

**Included in the project:**

* Textured walls
  
* A moving minimap
  
* Wall collision detection

**Some potential features to add in future updates:**

* Doors that can open to other rooms

* Sprites (for collectibles, enemies etc.)
